## Solution to Challenge 8

1. Run the system using docker-compose by running: `docker-compose up` in fuge/
2. To test that everything is working, point your browser to [http://localhost:10001]()

If you execute `docker ps` you should see that docker is now running our system
as a set of containers.


## Challenge 9

Add an environment file to manage the variables in order to cleanup our
_docker-compose.yml_ file a bit more.

_hint_ Look at the [docker-compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).
