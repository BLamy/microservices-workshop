## solution to challenge 8

1. you can run the system using docker-compose by running: `docker-compose up` in fuge/
2. To test that everything is working point your browser to http://localhost:10001

If you issue a `docker ps` you should see that docker is now running our system
as a set of containers.

## Challenge 9

Next we want to be able to use an environment file to manage the variables in order to cleanup our docker-compose file a bit more.

_hint_ Look at the docker-compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/.
