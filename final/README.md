## solution to challenge 8

1. you can run the system using docker-compose by running: `docker-compose up` in fuge/
2. To test that everything is working point your browser to http://localhost:10001

If you issue a `docker ps` you should see that docker is now running our system
as a set of containers.

Thats it - congratulations - you have succeeded in building an IoT microservice
based system out of docker containers!!
